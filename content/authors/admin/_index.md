I'm Katherine, and I am a first year PhD student at CU Boulder who is broadly interested in theoretical quantum information science.

In the past, I've worked on a wide variety of research projects, spanning fields such as, quantum optics, condensed matter physics, quantum metrology, and machine learning. I'm eager to continue my work in these fields during my PhD.

I am eager to talk about many different topics, so don't hesitate to reach out!
