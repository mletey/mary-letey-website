    **Supervisor:** [Professor Freddy Cachazo](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/freddy-cachazo). Investigating tree-level scattering amplitudes for gluons in Yang-Mills. By utilising colour decomposition, we consider partial amplitude formulas in the case of 3 negative-helicity gluons; in particular, we study their singularity structure using projective geometry.
