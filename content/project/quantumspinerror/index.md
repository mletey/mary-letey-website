  **Supervisors:** [Professor Roger Melko](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/roger-melko), [Schuyler Moss](https://mschuylermoss.github.io). Extending recent work pioneered at [PiQuIL](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/perimeter-institute-quantum-intelligence-lab-piquil) in approximating the groundstate wavefunction of a quantum lattice system using Recurrent Neural Networks: Investigated the effect of error and noisiness of the quantum data on the accuracy of the wavefunction and other physical quantities.
